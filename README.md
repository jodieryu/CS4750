# CS4750 - Database Systems Final Project

Group members: Katherine Qian, Jodie Ryu, Youbeen Shim, Joshua Ya.

> Objective: Completion of a complex project involving the creation of a database-related system.

## Description 

Our group was provided a MySQL database account and web space that was PHP enabled on CS servers. We had to entail the design of a database, with all accompanying evidence of its good design, along with a front-end application that interfaced with the database through record gathering, inserting, deleting, etc. 

We created a web interface that focuses on restaurants located in Charlottesville. This web space would be extremely useful to University of Virginia students, for finding places specific to Charlottesville. Furthermore, we include a bucket list / achievement feature created themselves or by location (ex. The Corner or Downtown) such that users can check off restaurants they have been to. We hope that students and families will use this website to find places to eat for any social gathering: casual get togethers, big events, special occasions, and more.

## Components in our Project

* Ability to search for specific restaurants, restaurants based on types of foods served, etc.
* Ability to search based on category or cuisine.
* Ability to create an account so users can save lists such as bucket list for restaurants they want to go to, restaurants they been to, and favorite restaurants.
* Ability for users filter searches.
